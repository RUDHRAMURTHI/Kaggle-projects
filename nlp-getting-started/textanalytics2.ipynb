Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any\\nof these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\n\\nWe are now trying to release all our books one month in advance\\nof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.\\n\\nPlease note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till\\nmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.\\nThe official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at\\nMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.

The\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\n\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\\n\\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\\nfrom Michael Hart\\'s salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\\ndon\\'t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\\n\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\n\\n\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Who\\'s there?\\n  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold\\nyour selfe\\n\\n   Bar. Long liue the King\\n\\n***\\n\\nAs I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\\nor letters they had often packed into a \"cliche\". . .this is the\\noriginal meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\\nto unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions\\nthat look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\\nabove. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming\\nShakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .\\n\\nThe answer is that they MAY have packed \"liue\" into a cliche at a\\ntime when they were out of \"v\"\\'s. . .possibly having used \"vv\" in\\nplace of some \"w\"\\'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,\\nas print was still quite expensive, and they didn\\'t want to spend\\nmore on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\\n\\nYou will find a lot of these kinds of \"errors\" in this text, as I\\nhave mentioned in other times and places, many \"scholars\" have an\\nextreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\\nvery high place in the \"canon\" of Shakespeare.  My father read an\\nassortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University\\nin England for several months in a glass room constructed for the\\npurpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available\\n. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,\\nthat Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a\\nvariety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\\nfor signing his name with several different spellings.\\n\\nSo, please take this into account when reading the comments below\\nmade by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors\\nthat are \"not\" errors. . . .\\n\\nSo. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,\\nhere is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare\\'s The first \\nPart of Henry the Sixt.\\n\\nMichael S. Hart\\nProject Gutenberg\\nExecutive Director\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nScanner\\'s Notes: What this is and isn\\'t.  This was taken from\\na copy of Shakespeare\\'s first folio and it is as close as I can\\ncome in ASCII to the printed text.\\n\\nThe elongated S\\'s have been changed to small s\\'s and the\\nconjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,\\npunctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the\\nprinted text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put\\ntogether a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the\\nGeneva Bible and Shakespeare\\'s First Folio and have unified\\nspellings according to this template), typo\\'s and expanded\\nabbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within\\nbrackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don\\'t like that\\nyou can delete everything within the brackets if you want a\\npurer Shakespeare.\\n\\nAnother thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual\\ndifferences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may\\nbe differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between\\nthis and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer\\'s\\nhabit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and\\nthen proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then\\ncontinuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn\\'t thrown away but\\nincorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.\\nThe text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different\\nFirst Folio editions\\' best pages.\\n\\nIf you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation\\nerrors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel\\nfree to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best\\netext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com\\nand davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.\\n\\nDavid Reed\\n\\nThe Tempest\\n\\nActus primus, Scena prima.\\n\\nA tempestuous noise of Thunder and Lightning heard: Enter a\\nShip-master,\\nand a Boteswaine.\\n\\n  Master: Bote-swaine\\n\\n  Botes: Heere Master: What cheere?\\n\\n  Master: Good: Speake to th\\' Mariners: fall\\ntoo\\'t, yarely, or we run our selves a ground,\\nbestirre, bestirre.\\n\\nEnter.\\n\\nEnter Mariners.\\n\\n  Botes: Heigh my hearts, cheerely, cheerely my harts:\\nyare, yare: Take in the toppe-sale: Tend to th\\' Masters\\nwhistle: Blow till thou burst thy winde, if roome enough.\\n\\nEnter Alonso, Sebastian, Anthonio, Ferdinando, Gonzalo, and\\nothers.\\n\\n  Alon: Good Boteswaine have care: where\\'s the Master?\\nPlay the men.\\n\\n  Botes: I pray now keepe below.\\n\\n  Anth: Where is the Master, Boson?\\n\\n  Botes: Do you not heare him? you marre our labour, Keepe your Cabines: you do assist the storme.\\n\\n  Gonz: Nay, good be patient.\\n\\n  Botes.

No I warrant you, I will not aduenture my\\ndiscretion so weakly: Will you laugh me asleepe, for I\\nam very heauy\\n\\n\\n   Ant. Go sleepe, and heare vs\\n\\n   Alon. What, all so soone asleepe?

Nor I, my spirits are nimble:\\nThey fell together all, as by consent\\nThey dropt, as by a Thunder-stroke: what might\\nWorthy Sebastian? O, what might? no more:\\nAnd yet, me thinkes I see it in thy face,\\nWhat thou should\\'st be: th\\' occasion speaks thee, and\\nMy strong imagination see\\'s a Crowne\\nDropping vpon thy head\\n\\n   Seb. What? art thou waking?\\n\\n  Ant. Do you not heare me speake?\\n\\n  Seb. I do, and surely\\nIt is a sleepy Language; and thou speak\\'st\\nOut of thy sleepe: What is it thou didst say?\\nThis is a strange repose, to be asleepe\\nWith eyes wide open: standing, speaking, mouing:\\nAnd yet so fast asleepe\\n\\n   Ant. Noble Sebastian,\\nThou let\\'st thy fortune sleepe: die rather: wink\\'st\\nWhiles thou art waking\\n\\n   Seb. Thou do\\'st snore distinctly,\\nThere\\'s meaning in thy snores\\n\\n   Ant. I am more serious then my custome: you\\nMust be so too, if heed me: which to do,\\nTrebbles thee o\\'re\\n\\n   Seb. Well: I am standing water\\n\\n   Ant. Ile teach you how to flow\\n\\n   Seb. Do so: to ebbe\\nHereditary Sloth instructs me\\n\\n   Ant. O!\\nIf you but knew how you the purpose cherish\\nWhiles thus you mocke it: how in stripping it\\nYou more inuest it: ebbing men, indeed\\n(Most often) do so neere the bottome run\\nBy their owne feare, or sloth\\n\\n   Seb. \\'Pre-thee say on,\\nThe setting of thine eye, and cheeke proclaime\\nA matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,\\nWhich throwes thee much to yeeld\\n\\n   Ant. Thus Sir:\\nAlthough this Lord of weake remembrance; this\\nWho shall be of as little memory\\nWhen he is earth\\'d, hath here almost perswaded\\n(For hee\\'s a Spirit of perswasion, onely\\nProfesses to perswade) the King his sonne\\'s aliue,\\n\\'Tis as impossible that hee\\'s vndrown\\'d,\\nAs he that sleepes heere, swims\\n\\n   Seb.

No hope that way, Is\\nAnother way so high a hope, that euen\\nAmbition cannot pierce a winke beyond\\nBut doubt discouery there. Will you grant with me\\nThat Ferdinand is drown\\'d\\n\\n   Seb. He\\'s gone\\n\\n   Ant. Then tell me, who\\'s the next heire of Naples?\\n\\n   Seb. Claribell\\n\\n   Ant.

The\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\n\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\\n\\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\\nfrom Michael Hart\\'s salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\\ndon\\'t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\\n\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\n\\n\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Who\\'s there?\\n  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold\\nyour selfe\\n\\n   Bar. Long liue the King\\n\\n***\\n\\nAs I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\\nor letters they had often packed into a \"cliche\". . .this is the\\noriginal meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\\nto unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions\\nthat look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\\nabove. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming\\nShakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .\\n\\nThe answer is that they MAY have packed \"liue\" into a cliche at a\\ntime when they were out of \"v\"\\'s. . .possibly having used \"vv\" in\\nplace of some \"w\"\\'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,\\nas print was still quite expensive, and they didn\\'t want to spend\\nmore on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\\n\\nYou will find a lot of these kinds of \"errors\" in this text, as I\\nhave mentioned in other times and places, many \"scholars\" have an\\nextreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\\nvery high place in the \"canon\" of Shakespeare.  My father read an\\nassortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University\\nin England for several months in a glass room constructed for the\\npurpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available\\n. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,\\nthat Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a\\nvariety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\\nfor signing his name with several different spellings.\\n\\nSo, please take this into account when reading the comments below\\nmade by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors\\nthat are \"not\" errors. . . .\\n\\nSo. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,\\nhere is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare\\'s The first \\nPart of Henry the Sixt.\\n\\nMichael S. Hart\\nProject Gutenberg\\nExecutive Director\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nScanner\\'s Notes: What this is and isn\\'t.  This was taken from\\na copy of Shakespeare\\'s first folio and it is as close as I can\\ncome in ASCII to the printed text.\\n\\nThe elongated S\\'s have been changed to small s\\'s and the\\nconjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,\\npunctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the\\nprinted text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put\\ntogether a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the\\nGeneva Bible and Shakespeare\\'s First Folio and have unified\\nspellings according to this template), typo\\'s and expanded\\nabbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within\\nbrackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don\\'t like that\\nyou can delete everything within the brackets if you want a\\npurer Shakespeare.\\n\\nAnother thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual\\ndifferences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may\\nbe differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between\\nthis and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer\\'s\\nhabit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and\\nthen proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then\\ncontinuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn\\'t thrown away but\\nincorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.\\nThe text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different\\nFirst Folio editions\\' best pages.\\n\\nIf you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation\\nerrors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel\\nfree to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best\\netext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com\\nand davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.\\n\\nDavid Reed\\n\\nThe Tempest\\n\\nActus primus, Scena prima.\\n\\nA tempestuous noise of Thunder and Lightning heard: Enter a\\nShip-master,\\nand a Boteswaine.\\n\\n  Master: Bote-swaine\\n\\n  Botes: Heere Master: What cheere?\\n\\n  Master: Good: Speake to th\\' Mariners: fall\\ntoo\\'t, yarely, or we run our selves a ground,\\nbestirre, bestirre.\\n\\nEnter.\\n\\nEnter Mariners.\\n\\n  Botes: Heigh my hearts, cheerely, cheerely my harts:\\nyare, yare: Take in the toppe-sale: Tend to th\\' Masters\\nwhistle: Blow till thou burst thy winde, if roome enough.\\n\\nEnter Alonso, Sebastian, Anthonio, Ferdinando, Gonzalo, and\\nothers.\\n\\n  Alon: Good Boteswaine have care: where\\'s the Master?\\nPlay the men.\\n\\n  Botes: I pray now keepe below.\\n\\n  Anth: Where is the Master, Boson?\\n\\n  Botes: Do you not heare him? you marre our labour, Keepe your Cabines: you do assist the storme.\\n\\n  Gonz: Nay, good be patient.\\n\\n  Botes.

I meane in a sort\\n\\n   Ant. That sort was well fish\\'d for\\n\\n   Gon. When I wore it at your daughters marriage\\n\\n   Alon. You cram these words into mine eares, against\\nthe stomacke of my sense: would I had neuer\\nMarried my daughter there: For comming thence\\nMy sonne is lost, and (in my rate) she too,\\nWho is so farre from Italy remoued,\\nI ne\\'re againe shall see her: O thou mine heire\\nOf Naples and of Millaine, what strange fish\\nHath made his meale on thee?\\n\\n  Fran. Sir he may liue,\\nI saw him beate the surges vnder him,\\nAnd ride vpon their backes; he trod the water\\nWhose enmity he flung aside: and brested\\nThe surge most swolne that met him: his bold head\\n\\'Boue the contentious waues he kept, and oared\\nHimselfe with his good armes in lusty stroke\\nTo th\\' shore; that ore his waue-worne basis bowed\\nAs stooping to releeue him: I not doubt\\nHe came aliue to Land\\n\\n   Alon. No, no, hee\\'s gone\\n\\n   Seb. Sir you may thank your selfe for this great losse,\\nThat would not blesse our Europe with your daughter,\\nBut rather loose her to an Affrican,\\nWhere she at least, is banish\\'d from your eye,\\nWho hath cause to wet the greefe on\\'t\\n\\n   Alon.

You were kneel\\'d too, & importun\\'d otherwise\\nBy all of vs: and the faire soule her selfe\\nWaigh\\'d betweene loathnesse, and obedience, at\\nWhich end o\\'th\\' beame should bow: we haue lost your son,\\nI feare for euer: Millaine and Naples haue\\nMo widdowes in them of this businesse making,\\nThen we bring men to comfort them:\\nThe faults your owne\\n\\n   Alon.

Yet he would be King on\\'t\\n\\n   Ant. The latter end of his Common-wealth forgets\\nthe beginning\\n\\n   Gon. All things in common Nature should produce\\nWithout sweat or endeuour: Treason, fellony,\\nSword, Pike, Knife, Gun, or neede of any Engine\\nWould I not haue: but Nature should bring forth\\nOf it owne kinde, all foyzon, all abundance\\nTo feed my innocent people\\n\\n   Seb.

Pre-thee no more: thou dost talke nothing to me\\n\\n   Gon. I do well beleeue your Highnesse, and did it\\nto minister occasion to these Gentlemen, who are of\\nsuch sensible and nimble Lungs, that they alwayes vse\\nto laugh at nothing\\n\\n   Ant. \\'Twas you we laugh\\'d at\\n\\n   Gon. Who, in this kind of merry fooling am nothing\\nto you: so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still\\n\\n   Ant. What a blow was there giuen?\\n\\n  Seb.

No I warrant you, I will not aduenture my\\ndiscretion so weakly: Will you laugh me asleepe, for I\\nam very heauy\\n\\n\\n   Ant. Go sleepe, and heare vs\\n\\n   Alon. What, all so soone asleepe?

Please you Sir,\\nDo not omit the heauy offer of it:\\nIt sildome visits sorrow, when it doth, it is a Comforter\\n\\n   Ant.

It is the quality o\\'th\\' Clymate\\n\\n   Seb. Why\\nDoth it not then our eye-lids sinke? I finde\\nNot my selfe dispos\\'d to sleep\\n\\n   Ant. Nor I, my spirits are nimble:\\nThey fell together all, as by consent\\nThey dropt, as by a Thunder-stroke: what might\\nWorthy Sebastian? O, what might? no more:\\nAnd yet, me thinkes I see it in thy face,\\nWhat thou should\\'st be: th\\' occasion speaks thee, and\\nMy strong imagination see\\'s a Crowne\\nDropping vpon thy head\\n\\n   Seb. What? art thou waking?\\n\\n  Ant. Do you not heare me speake?\\n\\n  Seb. I do, and surely\\nIt is a sleepy Language; and thou speak\\'st\\nOut of thy sleepe: What is it thou didst say?\\nThis is a strange repose, to be asleepe\\nWith eyes wide open: standing, speaking, mouing:\\nAnd yet so fast asleepe\\n\\n   Ant. Noble Sebastian,\\nThou let\\'st thy fortune sleepe: die rather: wink\\'st\\nWhiles thou art waking\\n\\n   Seb. Thou do\\'st snore distinctly,\\nThere\\'s meaning in thy snores\\n\\n   Ant. I am more serious then my custome: you\\nMust be so too, if heed me: which to do,\\nTrebbles thee o\\'re\\n\\n   Seb. Well: I am standing water\\n\\n   Ant. Ile teach you how to flow\\n\\n   Seb. Do so: to ebbe\\nHereditary Sloth instructs me\\n\\n   Ant. O!\\nIf you but knew how you the purpose cherish\\nWhiles thus you mocke it: how in stripping it\\nYou more inuest it: ebbing men, indeed\\n(Most often) do so neere the bottome run\\nBy their owne feare, or sloth\\n\\n   Seb. \\'Pre-thee say on,\\nThe setting of thine eye, and cheeke proclaime\\nA matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,\\nWhich throwes thee much to yeeld\\n\\n   Ant. Thus Sir:\\nAlthough this Lord of weake remembrance; this\\nWho shall be of as little memory\\nWhen he is earth\\'d, hath here almost perswaded\\n(For hee\\'s a Spirit of perswasion, onely\\nProfesses to perswade) the King his sonne\\'s aliue,\\n\\'Tis as impossible that hee\\'s vndrown\\'d,\\nAs he that sleepes heere, swims\\n\\n   Seb.

No hope that way, Is\\nAnother way so high a hope, that euen\\nAmbition cannot pierce a winke beyond\\nBut doubt discouery there. Will you grant with me\\nThat Ferdinand is drown\\'d\\n\\n   Seb.

Who\\'s there?\\n  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold\\nyour selfe\\n\\n   Bar. Long liue the King\\n\\n***\\n\\nAs I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\\nor letters they had often packed into a \"cliche\". . .this is the\\noriginal meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\\nto unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions\\nthat look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\\nabove. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming\\nShakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .\\n\\nThe answer is that they MAY have packed \"liue\" into a cliche at a\\ntime when they were out of \"v\"\\'s. . .possibly having used \"vv\" in\\nplace of some \"w\"\\'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,\\nas print was still quite expensive, and they didn\\'t want to spend\\nmore on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\\n\\nYou will find a lot of these kinds of \"errors\" in this text, as I\\nhave mentioned in other times and places, many \"scholars\" have an\\nextreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\\nvery high place in the \"canon\" of Shakespeare.  My father read an\\nassortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University\\nin England for several months in a glass room constructed for the\\npurpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available\\n. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,\\nthat Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a\\nvariety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\\nfor signing his name with several different spellings.\\n\\nSo, please take this into account when reading the comments below\\nmade by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors\\nthat are \"not\" errors. . . .\\n\\nSo. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,\\nhere is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare\\'s The first \\nPart of Henry the Sixt.\\n\\nMichael S. Hart\\nProject Gutenberg\\nExecutive Director\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nScanner\\'s Notes: What this is and isn\\'t.  This was taken from\\na copy of Shakespeare\\'s first folio and it is as close as I can\\ncome in ASCII to the printed text.\\n\\nThe elongated S\\'s have been changed to small s\\'s and the\\nconjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,\\npunctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the\\nprinted text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put\\ntogether a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the\\nGeneva Bible and Shakespeare\\'s First Folio and have unified\\nspellings according to this template), typo\\'s and expanded\\nabbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within\\nbrackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don\\'t like that\\nyou can delete everything within the brackets if you want a\\npurer Shakespeare.\\n\\nAnother thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual\\ndifferences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may\\nbe differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between\\nthis and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer\\'s\\nhabit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and\\nthen proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then\\ncontinuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn\\'t thrown away but\\nincorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.\\nThe text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different\\nFirst Folio editions\\' best pages.\\n\\nIf you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation\\nerrors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel\\nfree to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best\\netext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com\\nand davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.\\n\\nDavid Reed\\n\\nThe Tempest\\n\\nActus primus, Scena prima.\\n\\nA tempestuous noise of Thunder and Lightning heard: Enter a\\nShip-master,\\nand a Boteswaine.\\n\\n  Master: Bote-swaine\\n\\n  Botes: Heere Master: What cheere?\\n\\n  Master: Good: Speake to th\\' Mariners: fall\\ntoo\\'t, yarely, or we run our selves a ground,\\nbestirre, bestirre.\\n\\nEnter.\\n\\nEnter Mariners.\\n\\n  Botes: Heigh my hearts, cheerely, cheerely my harts:\\nyare, yare: Take in the toppe-sale: Tend to th\\' Masters\\nwhistle: Blow till thou burst thy winde, if roome enough.\\n\\nEnter Alonso, Sebastian, Anthonio, Ferdinando, Gonzalo, and\\nothers.\\n\\n  Alon: Good Boteswaine have care: where\\'s the Master?\\nPlay the men.\\n\\n  Botes: I pray now keepe below.\\n\\n  Anth: Where is the Master, Boson?\\n\\n  Botes: Do you not heare him? you marre our labour, Keepe your Cabines: you do assist the storme.\\n\\n  Gonz: Nay, good be patient.\\n\\n  Botes.

The\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\n\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\\n\\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\\nfrom Michael Hart\\'s salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\\ndon\\'t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\\n\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\n\\n\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Long liue the King\\n\\n***\\n\\nAs I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\\nor letters they had often packed into a \"cliche\". . .this is the\\noriginal meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\\nto unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions\\nthat look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\\nabove. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming\\nShakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .\\n\\nThe answer is that they MAY have packed \"liue\" into a cliche at a\\ntime when they were out of \"v\"\\'s. . .possibly having used \"vv\" in\\nplace of some \"w\"\\'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,\\nas print was still quite expensive, and they didn\\'t want to spend\\nmore on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\\n\\nYou will find a lot of these kinds of \"errors\" in this text, as I\\nhave mentioned in other times and places, many \"scholars\" have an\\nextreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\\nvery high place in the \"canon\" of Shakespeare.  My father read an\\nassortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University\\nin England for several months in a glass room constructed for the\\npurpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available\\n. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,\\nthat Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a\\nvariety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\\nfor signing his name with several different spellings.\\n\\nSo, please take this into account when reading the comments below\\nmade by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors\\nthat are \"not\" errors. . . .\\n\\nSo. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,\\nhere is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare\\'s The first \\nPart of Henry the Sixt.\\n\\nMichael S. Hart\\nProject Gutenberg\\nExecutive Director\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nScanner\\'s Notes: What this is and isn\\'t.  This was taken from\\na copy of Shakespeare\\'s first folio and it is as close as I can\\ncome in ASCII to the printed text.\\n\\nThe elongated S\\'s have been changed to small s\\'s and the\\nconjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,\\npunctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the\\nprinted text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put\\ntogether a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the\\nGeneva Bible and Shakespeare\\'s First Folio and have unified\\nspellings according to this template), typo\\'s and expanded\\nabbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within\\nbrackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don\\'t like that\\nyou can delete everything within the brackets if you want a\\npurer Shakespeare.\\n\\nAnother thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual\\ndifferences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may\\nbe differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between\\nthis and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer\\'s\\nhabit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and\\nthen proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then\\ncontinuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn\\'t thrown away but\\nincorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.\\nThe text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different\\nFirst Folio editions\\' best pages.\\n\\nIf you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation\\nerrors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel\\nfree to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best\\netext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com\\nand davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.\\n\\nDavid Reed\\n\\nThe Tempest\\n\\nActus primus, Scena prima.\\n\\nA tempestuous noise of Thunder and Lightning heard: Enter a\\nShip-master,\\nand a Boteswaine.\\n\\n  Master: Bote-swaine\\n\\n  Botes: Heere Master: What cheere?\\n\\n  Master: Good: Speake to th\\' Mariners: fall\\ntoo\\'t, yarely, or we run our selves a ground,\\nbestirre, bestirre.\\n\\nEnter.\\n\\nEnter Mariners.\\n\\n  Botes: Heigh my hearts, cheerely, cheerely my harts:\\nyare, yare: Take in the toppe-sale: Tend to th\\' Masters\\nwhistle: Blow till thou burst thy winde, if roome enough.\\n\\nEnter Alonso, Sebastian, Anthonio, Ferdinando, Gonzalo, and\\nothers.\\n\\n  Alon: Good Boteswaine have care: where\\'s the Master?\\nPlay the men.\\n\\n  Botes: I pray now keepe below.\\n\\n  Anth: Where is the Master, Boson?\\n\\n  Botes: Do you not heare him? you marre our labour, Keepe your Cabines: you do assist the storme.\\n\\n  Gonz: Nay, good be patient.\\n\\n  Botes.

The\\ntime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours\\nto get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright\\nsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This\\nprojected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value\\nper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2\\nmillion dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text\\nfiles per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+\\nIf these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the\\ntotal should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.\\n\\nThe Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext\\nFiles by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]\\nThis is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,\\nwhich is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.\\n\\nAt our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third\\nof that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we\\nmanage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly\\nfrom Michael Hart\\'s salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an\\nassortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few\\nmore years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we\\ndon\\'t want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.\\n\\nWe need your donations more than ever!\\n\\n\\nAll donations should be made to \"Project Gutenberg/CMU\": and are\\ntax deductible to the extent allowable by law.

Who\\'s there?\\n  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold\\nyour selfe\\n\\n   Bar. Long liue the King\\n\\n***\\n\\nAs I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\\nor letters they had often packed into a \"cliche\". . .this is the\\noriginal meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\\nto unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions\\nthat look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\\nabove. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming\\nShakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .\\n\\nThe answer is that they MAY have packed \"liue\" into a cliche at a\\ntime when they were out of \"v\"\\'s. . .possibly having used \"vv\" in\\nplace of some \"w\"\\'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,\\nas print was still quite expensive, and they didn\\'t want to spend\\nmore on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\\n\\nYou will find a lot of these kinds of \"errors\" in this text, as I\\nhave mentioned in other times and places, many \"scholars\" have an\\nextreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\\nvery high place in the \"canon\" of Shakespeare.  My father read an\\nassortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University\\nin England for several months in a glass room constructed for the\\npurpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available\\n. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,\\nthat Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a\\nvariety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\\nfor signing his name with several different spellings.\\n\\nSo, please take this into account when reading the comments below\\nmade by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors\\nthat are \"not\" errors. . . .\\n\\nSo. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,\\nhere is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare\\'s The first \\nPart of Henry the Sixt.\\n\\nMichael S. Hart\\nProject Gutenberg\\nExecutive Director\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nScanner\\'s Notes: What this is and isn\\'t.  This was taken from\\na copy of Shakespeare\\'s first folio and it is as close as I can\\ncome in ASCII to the printed text.\\n\\nThe elongated S\\'s have been changed to small s\\'s and the\\nconjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,\\npunctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the\\nprinted text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put\\ntogether a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the\\nGeneva Bible and Shakespeare\\'s First Folio and have unified\\nspellings according to this template), typo\\'s and expanded\\nabbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within\\nbrackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don\\'t like that\\nyou can delete everything within the brackets if you want a\\npurer Shakespeare.\\n\\nAnother thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual\\ndifferences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may\\nbe differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between\\nthis and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer\\'s\\nhabit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and\\nthen proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then\\ncontinuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn\\'t thrown away but\\nincorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.\\nThe text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different\\nFirst Folio editions\\' best pages.\\n\\nIf you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation\\nerrors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel\\nfree to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best\\netext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com\\nand davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.\\n\\nDavid Reed\\n\\nThe Tempest\\n\\nActus primus, Scena prima.\\n\\nA tempestuous noise of Thunder and Lightning heard: Enter a\\nShip-master,\\nand a Boteswaine.\\n\\n  Master: Bote-swaine\\n\\n  Botes: Heere Master: What cheere?\\n\\n  Master: Good: Speake to th\\' Mariners: fall\\ntoo\\'t, yarely, or we run our selves a ground,\\nbestirre, bestirre.\\n\\nEnter.\\n\\nEnter Mariners.\\n\\n  Botes: Heigh my hearts, cheerely, cheerely my harts:\\nyare, yare: Take in the toppe-sale: Tend to th\\' Masters\\nwhistle: Blow till thou burst thy winde, if roome enough.\\n\\nEnter Alonso, Sebastian, Anthonio, Ferdinando, Gonzalo, and\\nothers.\\n\\n  Alon: Good Boteswaine have care: where\\'s the Master?\\nPlay the men.\\n\\n  Botes: I pray now keepe below.\\n\\n  Anth: Where is the Master, Boson?\\n\\n  Botes: Do you not heare him? you marre our labour, Keepe your Cabines: you do assist the storme.\\n\\n  Gonz: Nay, good be patient.\\n\\n  Botes.

His word is more then the miraculous Harpe\\n\\n   Seb. He hath rais\\'d the wall, and houses too\\n\\n   Ant. What impossible matter wil he make easy next?\\n\\n  Seb.

You cram these words into mine eares, against\\nthe stomacke of my sense: would I had neuer\\nMarried my daughter there: For comming thence\\nMy sonne is lost, and (in my rate) she too,\\nWho is so farre from Italy remoued,\\nI ne\\'re againe shall see her: O thou mine heire\\nOf Naples and of Millaine, what strange fish\\nHath made his meale on thee?\\n\\n  Fran.

No, no, hee\\'s gone\\n\\n   Seb. Sir you may thank your selfe for this great losse,\\nThat would not blesse our Europe with your daughter,\\nBut rather loose her to an Affrican,\\nWhere she at least, is banish\\'d from your eye,\\nWho hath cause to wet the greefe on\\'t\\n\\n   Alon.

You were kneel\\'d too, & importun\\'d otherwise\\nBy all of vs: and the faire soule her selfe\\nWaigh\\'d betweene loathnesse, and obedience, at\\nWhich end o\\'th\\' beame should bow: we haue lost your son,\\nI feare for euer: Millaine and Naples haue\\nMo widdowes in them of this businesse making,\\nThen we bring men to comfort them:\\nThe faults your owne\\n\\n   Alon.

Yet he would be King on\\'t\\n\\n   Ant. The latter end of his Common-wealth forgets\\nthe beginning\\n\\n   Gon. All things in common Nature should produce\\nWithout sweat or endeuour: Treason, fellony,\\nSword, Pike, Knife, Gun, or neede of any Engine\\nWould I not haue: but Nature should bring forth\\nOf it owne kinde, all foyzon, all abundance\\nTo feed my innocent people\\n\\n   Seb.

Pre-thee no more: thou dost talke nothing to me\\n\\n   Gon. I do well beleeue your Highnesse, and did it\\nto minister occasion to these Gentlemen, who are of\\nsuch sensible and nimble Lungs, that they alwayes vse\\nto laugh at nothing\\n\\n   Ant. \\'Twas you we laugh\\'d at\\n\\n   Gon. Who, in this kind of merry fooling am nothing\\nto you: so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still\\n\\n   Ant. What a blow was there giuen?\\n\\n  Seb. And it had not falne flat-long\\n\\n   Gon. You are Gentlemen of braue mettal: you would\\nlift the Moone out of her spheare, if she would continue\\nin it fiue weekes without changing.\\n\\nEnter Ariell playing solemne Musicke.\\n\\n  Seb. We would so, and then go a Bat-fowling\\n\\n   Ant. Nay good my Lord, be not angry\\n\\n   Gon. No I warrant you, I will not aduenture my\\ndiscretion so weakly: Will you laugh me asleepe, for I\\nam very heauy\\n\\n\\n   Ant. Go sleepe, and heare vs\\n\\n   Alon. What, all so soone asleepe? I wish mine eyes\\nWould (with themselues) shut vp my thoughts,\\nI finde they are inclin\\'d to do so\\n\\n   Seb. Please you Sir,\\nDo not omit the heauy offer of it:\\nIt sildome visits sorrow, when it doth, it is a Comforter\\n\\n   Ant. We two my Lord, will guard your person,\\nWhile you take your rest, and watch your safety\\n\\n   Alon. Thanke you: Wondrous heauy\\n\\n   Seb. What a strange drowsines possesses them?\\n\\n  Ant. It is the quality o\\'th\\' Clymate\\n\\n   Seb. Why\\nDoth it not then our eye-lids sinke? I finde\\nNot my selfe dispos\\'d to sleep\\n\\n   Ant. Nor I, my spirits are nimble:\\nThey fell together all, as by consent\\nThey dropt, as by a Thunder-stroke: what might\\nWorthy Sebastian? O, what might? no more:\\nAnd yet, me thinkes I see it in thy face,\\nWhat thou should\\'st be: th\\' occasion speaks thee, and\\nMy strong imagination see\\'s a Crowne\\nDropping vpon thy head\\n\\n   Seb. What? art thou waking?\\n\\n  Ant. Do you not heare me speake?\\n\\n  Seb. I do, and surely\\nIt is a sleepy Language; and thou speak\\'st\\nOut of thy sleepe: What is it thou didst say?\\nThis is a strange repose, to be asleepe\\nWith eyes wide open: standing, speaking, mouing:\\nAnd yet so fast asleepe\\n\\n   Ant. Noble Sebastian,\\nThou let\\'st thy fortune sleepe: die rather: wink\\'st\\nWhiles thou art waking\\n\\n   Seb. Thou do\\'st snore distinctly,\\nThere\\'s meaning in thy snores\\n\\n   Ant. I am more serious then my custome: you\\nMust be so too, if heed me: which to do,\\nTrebbles thee o\\'re\\n\\n   Seb. Well: I am standing water\\n\\n   Ant. Ile teach you how to flow\\n\\n   Seb. Do so: to ebbe\\nHereditary Sloth instructs me\\n\\n   Ant. O!\\nIf you but knew how you the purpose cherish\\nWhiles thus you mocke it: how in stripping it\\nYou more inuest it: ebbing men, indeed\\n(Most often) do so neere the bottome run\\nBy their owne feare, or sloth\\n\\n   Seb. \\'Pre-thee say on,\\nThe setting of thine eye, and cheeke proclaime\\nA matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,\\nWhich throwes thee much to yeeld\\n\\n   Ant. Thus Sir:\\nAlthough this Lord of weake remembrance; this\\nWho shall be of as little memory\\nWhen he is earth\\'d, hath here almost perswaded\\n(For hee\\'s a Spirit of perswasion, onely\\nProfesses to perswade) the King his sonne\\'s aliue,\\n\\'Tis as impossible that hee\\'s vndrown\\'d,\\nAs he that sleepes heere, swims\\n\\n   Seb. I haue no hope\\nThat hee\\'s vndrown\\'d\\n\\n   Ant. O, out of that no hope,\\nWhat great hope haue you? No hope that way, Is\\nAnother way so high a hope, that euen\\nAmbition cannot pierce a winke beyond\\nBut doubt discouery there. Will you grant with me\\nThat Ferdinand is drown\\'d\\n\\n   Seb. He\\'s gone\\n\\n   Ant. Then tell me, who\\'s the next heire of Naples?\\n\\n   Seb. Claribell\\n\\n   Ant.

What stuffe is this? How say you?\\n\\'Tis true my brothers daughter\\'s Queene of Tunis,\\nSo is she heyre of Naples, \\'twixt which Regions\\nThere is some space\\n\\n   Ant.
